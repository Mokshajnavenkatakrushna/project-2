## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Notes

- **Only pending and confirmed orders** can be cancelled
- **Shipped, delivered, or already cancelled orders** cannot be cancelled
- The cancel button only appears for orders that can be cancelled
- Changes are saved automatically and persist across page reloads
- Order cancellation is supported in multiple languages (English, Hindi, Telugu)

## üîß Troubleshooting

### If You Don't See Orders:
If you don't see any orders in the Order History tab, it means:
1. **You need to login first** - the mock orders are only created when you're logged in
2. **The user authentication might not be working properly**

**Solution:** Try logging in first, then go to Profile ‚Üí Order History tab, and you should see the 2 mock orders ready for testing!

### If Cancel Button Doesn't Appear:
- Check that the order status is either "pending" or "confirmed"
- Orders with status "shipped", "delivered", or "cancelled" cannot be cancelled

### If Cancellation Doesn't Work:
- Check the browser console (F12) for any error messages
- Ensure you're logged in and the user session is active
- Try refreshing the page and logging in again
